# CacheManager Refactor Checklist

This checklist outlines the approach to refactoring the CacheManager codebase. The changes will be implemented in multiple phases, focusing on improving code quality, performance, and feature set.

## Phase 1: Code Cleanliness and Type Safety

- [x] Add comprehensive type annotations to all functions and methods
- [x] Add detailed docstrings following Google style
- [x] Add proper exception handling with custom exception classes
- [x] Implement proper logging with correlation IDs
- [x] Normalize naming conventions across the codebase
- [x] Remove duplicate code and implement helper functions

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization

- [x] Implement connection pooling for Redis
- [x] Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
- [x] Optimize serialization/deserialization
- [x] Implement batching for multi-get/multi-set operations
- [x] Add compression support for large values
- [x] Introduce lazy loading for connections

## Phase 3: Core Improvements

- [x] Replace internal data structures with more efficient ones
- [x] Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
- [x] Implement proper TTL handling in all cache layers
- [x] Add namespace support for cache isolation
- [x] Improve thread safety with proper locking
- [x] Implement retries with backoff

## Phase 4: Feature Enhancement

- [x] Implement layered caching strategy (Memory -> Redis -> Disk)
- [x] Add read-through and write-through support
- [x] Add cache statistics and monitoring
- [x] Implement eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
- [x] Add support for cache expiration and automatic cleanup
- [x] Implement health checks and circuit breakers

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

- [x] Implement telemetry and logging enhancements
- [x] Add distributed locking capabilities
- [x] Implement cache sharding for better distribution
- [x] Add cross-node cache invalidation
- [x] Implement security features (encryption, signing)
- [x] Add cache warmup functionality
- [x] Implement adaptive TTL based on access patterns

## Phase 6: Testing and Documentation

- [x] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Add integration tests for cache layers
- [x] Implement benchmarking tests
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Add usage examples
- [x] Create Docker environment for testing

## Phase 7: Developer Experience

- [x] Add configuration validation
- [x] Implement better error messages
- [x] Create helper utilities for common operations
- [x] Add debugging tools and utilities
- [x] Implement proper cleanup of resources

## Phase 8: Production Readiness

- [x] Add support for high availability
- [x] Implement proper shutdown and cleanup
- [x] Add support for monitoring and alerting
- [x] Implement performance tuning options
- [x] Add support for cloud environments
